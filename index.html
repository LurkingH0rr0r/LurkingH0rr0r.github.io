	<h1><em>eportfolio</em> of Patrick Shorey</h1>
	<p><em>Created for MECH460/464, Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Queen's University.</em></p>
	<p>I am a 4th year mechanical engineering student at Queen's University. This site is a repository for a selection of design work and technical writing completed as a student and in professional engineering settings. Also included are photographs of the ships I most recently served aboard. These are all found under <a href="/blog">work</a>, and meant to give greater context to the experiences described in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/Patrick-Shorey/Patrick-Shorey.github.io/raw/master/pdfs/resume.pdf">cv</a>. A more detailed discussion of my interests, with respect to MECH 460/464, is given in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/Patrick-Shorey/Patrick-Shorey.github.io/raw/master/pdfs/coverletter-MECH462.pdf">letter of interest</a>. To add some personality, I have also included some <a href="/photo">photography</a>.</p>
