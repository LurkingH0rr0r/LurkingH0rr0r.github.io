	<h1><em>eportfolio</em> of Patrick Shorey</h1>
	<p><em>Mechanical Engineering student at Queen's University.</em></p>
	<p>I am a 4th year mechanical engineering student at Queen's University (2020 graduation). This site is meant give additional context to my work history, as detailed in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/Patrick-Shorey/Patrick-Shorey.github.io/raw/master/pdfs/resume.pdf">cv</a>. Under <a href="/blog">work</a> you can find examples of design work and technical writing. Also included are photographs of the ships I most recently served aboard. For a personal touch I have included some of my own <a href="/photo">photography</a>.</p>
